# socialmediaanalytics

The objective of this project is to analyze conversations on
Twitter about the artificial intelligence topic. 

The insights obtained would be used to build a website dedicated the subject. 

To start the research, I will collect tweets that mention the
terms "Artificial Intelligence", "Machine Learning",  and
"Deep Learning". This will be done through the Twitter API.

Then, all the content will be analyzed in order to find most
frequent words, its sentiment, users with the most retweets
and other analysis.
